When I saw they would be showing infamous eggs of the House of Faberge from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA), I knew I had to go!

Tucked away near the gelateria and the garden, the Gallery is pretty much hidden from view. It's what real estate agents would call ""cozy"" or ""charming"" - basically any euphemism for small.

That being said, you can still see wonderful art at a gallery of any size, so why the two *s you ask? Let me tell you:

* pricing for this, while relatively inexpensive for a Las Vegas attraction, is completely over the top. For the space and the amount of art you can fit in there, it is a bit much.
* it's not kid friendly at all. Seriously, don't bring them.
* the security is not trained properly for the show. When the curating and design teams collaborate for exhibitions, there is a definite flow. That means visitors should view the art in a certain sequence, whether it be by historical period or cultural significance (this is how audio guides are usually developed). When I arrived in the gallery I could not tell where to start, and security was certainly not helpful. I was told to ""just look around"" and ""do whatever."" 

At such a *fine* institution, I find the lack of knowledge and respect for the art appalling.",2015-04-15 05:21:16

So where do I begin, we got the menu and there was not much of a selection. So we decided to order from the appetizer side and had the Mini Chimis, rice, beans anda quesadilla. The server brought us some chips and salsa. The chips tasted like old oil and the salsa was clumpy and watery. We got our quesadilla and Mini Chimis. The Mini Chimis had no flavor unless you call the taste of oil flavor. The beans also had no flavor and the rice was under cooked. I would like to say the only thing there that did taste good was the water but that was before the server put her finger in my cup to refill it. Can't say that we will ever make it back there..",2015-11-05 02:49:24

A decade later I still go every few months and the food is still a good. Some of the cashiers have watched my sister grow from an infant to a preteen to put it into perspective. 

The food is incredibly cheap and very quickly made. The chicken corn soup and spring roll has tasted the same for over a decade. 

The Szchewan chicken over fried rice, the beef ho fun, Singapore noodles, Malay noodles, house delight, deep fried tentacles, deep fried squid, the deep fried pork chops over fried rice and the Shanghai noodles are a must try. 

I can usually get an entree with soup or a spring roll for about $10-$15 depending on how hungry I am. You can usually feed a family of 4 on about $20-$30 here which is great!",2015-01-18 15:12:42

I used to work just up the street from here so if we finished early enough, myself and my co-workers would swing by for a cold beer or two before last call. Beer prices were good and the taps clean, which is a plus.

As for the food, I've had the burger, wings and pasta, and all were very good. I was especially impressed with the pasta (they have pasta night on Tuesdays, and I believe it's $5 a dish for either spaghetti with meatballs, lasagna or fettuccini with wine sauce). For such a good price and given that it's pub and not a pasta place, the quality is impressive.

The owner and staff are all very friendly. Prices are good. I believe they also have a burger special on one of the weekdays as well.

The sticky bun was really nice, but a bit dry. The bourbon glaze really helped it out, but I'm sure they're fantastic if they were straight out of the oven.
The Dirty got chocolate was really great, not super sweet, and just enough chocolate to not come across so strong. I personally don't like super sweet hot chocolate, and this was perfect. My latte was great, FV is really my go to and I wasn't at all let down. The toast was an amazing 9 grain toast with thick crust, and the added bacon on top really made it.

However, I have been there several times, and one server in particular is extremely rude. He is a short dude with plastic rimmed glasses and spiked up hair. I don't know his name, but here are some examples of what he has said or done:
1) Starts taking away your food and wiping your table without asking you if you're done and there is visibly still food on the plate in an attempt to get you to pay your bill. Mind you, I am one of those ideal diners who is considerate when others are waiting and will eat my meal reasonably fast.  I know they are trying to get people in and out.
2) Throws sometimes subtle, sometimes not so subtle attitude at you.
3) Disciplined my brother (who has special needs) for occasionally kicking the bottom of the bench.

Food is decent, but because of this one server, I will not be visiting this restaurant again.  I pay good money to have a decent dining experience, not to have some stranger throw attitude at me and my family.

The Harlem Underground is housed in the space occupied by the formerly named Irie. Despite having passed Irie about a billion times, it just never looked very inviting, so when I saw that they mixed things up a bit, I thought I'd give it a try. A new interior and a new menu has apparently done wonders for Harlem Underground. 

My interest was piqued when I saw that they served ""soul food"", which I also consider ""southern food"". Being from the American South, I miss what I consider ""home"" or ""comfort"" foods, which would include pretty much everything on the Harlem Underground menu. Their brunch includes such southern delights as Sweet Potato Waffles, Crawfish Etouffee, Frog Legs, and pecan-covered French Toast. I chose the Harlem Benny, which, despite its name, isn't your traditional eggs benedict. Rather, instead of english muffins, HU serves the perfectly cooked poached eggs over a thin sweet potato pancake that's covered with sausage and grits (!). A cheesy hollaindaise is served on the side for dipping or pouring. Also served on the plate was the most delicious side salad EVAR -- baby greens, pear, red and yellow peppers, and pomegranate seeds!

As per usual, I ordered a half order of the French Toast and asked them to surprise me with which one. They were more than accommodating and immediately said ""sure, we can do that -- is $2 fair?"".  

Overal;, the food was fabulous -- very well flavoured, temperature-appropriate, and plentiful. I had a latte with brunch and it was also very good. 

Service was exceptional -- friendly, attentive, and not overly ""in your face"". 

I took a glance at the dinner menu and it looked equally appealing. I will definitely go back to the Harlem Underground -- I just hope it's as good the second time around!

They nonchalantly ignore you so you beg for service! lol At least that is my experience but here is the deal. I did not know that it was counter only service. I DID know that they are dog friendly which being a big animal lover with 4 dogs that lives in the neighborhood is a big deal for me. I will throw my hard earned bucks to local establishments like this! I decided to go in today with one of my dogs and tried to get service which at first it was ok. I got a younger gentleman in which I was able to get his attention, then an older guy (Bryan) that I have seen my one other visit there before took over the bar area. Since I know I cannot walk in with my dog I tried to get his attention. Bryan saw me but obviously decided best to not ask me if I need any help or anything at all and talk to some folks (probably regulars) at the bar area and JUST IGNORE ME. I went back to my table upset and disappointed. I wanted to stay and have another drink and even order food but I decided against it. I expressed my feelings to him on the service. I told him it was an opportunity lost on their end. They had my card on hold as I was planning on staying longer and I asked for it back. He did comp me and I was appreciative of the fact- just wish it did not have to come to that. 

I will give them another try...just hope the owner reads this and knows customer service is EVERYTHING.",2016-04-12 02:12:00

It's a very small restaurant. There's probably a total of 8 tables. But the establishment was very clean. I had a michelada which was very good! One of the best I've had. And for appetizer I had their seafood guacamole which was AMAZING! For my plate I had their lomita ceviche which was spicy! But I love spicy so it was perfect for me! I will take one star off due to the server not being 5 star. We had to keep waiving her down anytime we needed anything. Over all I loved it and will be returning.,2018-04-17 00:33:38

I was a customer of Prime Cable for years.  Cox was GREAT when Steve Schorr was with them.  They used to care about customer service.  Now they have taken The Comcast route, and just want to stick it to people whenever they can. I have had several addresses, and NEVER been charged an installation fee.  $60!  And these people think I am going to trust them again when they didn't tell me in the first place.  So much for being a loyal customer.  I had a contract for 1 year in Tucson with Cox.  They said they would transfer my service to Las Vegas.  I am now paying about $20 per month, and Cox charged me $60!  What a joke!  I almost ""bundled"" my services with them.  Forget TV!  Forget Cox!  A loyal 30 year customer means nothing to them.  No wonder so many companies are going out of business.
